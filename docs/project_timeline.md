  - Implement techniques like experience replay and target networks to enhance learning.

## Phase 6: Evaluation and Benchmarking
- **Week 11-12**:
  - Evaluate the agent's performance based on criteria such as total reward, success rate, and convergence speed.
  - Compare the agent's performance against benchmarks like GPT Gemini and Claude AI.
  - Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the design.

## Phase 7: Finalization and Deployment Preparation
- **Week 13-14**:
  - Finalize the implementation based on evaluation results.
  - Prepare documentation and user guides for the reasoning agent.
  - Plan for deployment and integration into the target environment.

## Conclusion
The project timeline outlined above provides a structured approach to developing the reasoning agent. Each phase has specific goals and deliverables that contribute to the overall success of the project. The next steps involve implementing the components, training the agent, and evaluating its performance against established benchmarks.
