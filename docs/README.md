# Reasoning Agent Advanced

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a reasoning agent that surpasses the capabilities of GPT Gemini and Anthropic's Claude AI. The primary focus is on leveraging reinforcement learning to achieve a 100% pass rate in various reasoning tasks.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an advanced reasoning agent that can effectively model and reason about complex environments and interactions. By incorporating state-of-the-art techniques in recursive reasoning and probabilistic modeling, the agent will be able to make informed decisions and adapt to changing scenarios.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the reasoning agent.
  - `agent.py`: Implementation of the reasoning agent.
- `tests/`: Contains the test cases for the reasoning agent.
  - `test_agent.py`: Tests for the reasoning agent.
- `docs/`: Contains the documentation for the project.
  - `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow
- OpenAI Gym (optional, for reinforcement learning environment)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/reasoning-agent.git
   cd reasoning-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv reasoning-agent-venv
   source reasoning-agent-venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow gym
   ```

## Development

### High-Level Architecture

The reasoning agent will be designed based on the following key components:
- **Recursive Reasoning Graph (R2G)**: Models the recursive reasoning process of agents.
- **Probabilistic Recursive Reasoning (PR2)**: Uses probabilistic modeling to approximate opponents' conditional policies.

### Core Components

- **Agent**: The main reasoning agent that interacts with the environment and learns from it.
- **Environment**: The simulated environment in which the agent operates and learns.
- **Learning Algorithms**: The reinforcement learning algorithms used to train the agent.
